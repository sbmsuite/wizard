Wizard
======

This plugin allows you to create wizards on the fly without manipulating your DB
or worrying about transitions, states, etc. You can declare the previous and nexts steps
for each action by simply naming the action of the corresponding step. It also allows you
to use any model along with any wizard as many times as you want. All you have to do is 
create a template for each wizard action. Check at the example section to better understand how
it works.

I didn't comment any of my code. I'll try to get around to it, but I'm busy as hell. The code is very
basic and anyone that understands ruby/rails please feel free to comment it for me. 

Thanks

Example
=======

Create a new wizard controller for each wizard you wish to create.
* Don't name your wizards like my_long_wizard_name_wizard. It will break the helpers.
Name your wizard like so. mylongwizardname
I like to name my wizards ending with the word wizard
orderwizard becomes OrderWizard < ApplicationController ... if you dont like that sorry.

So install the plugin into your vendor/plugins like normal

# next generate a new controller wizard
script/generate controller customwizard

# Your Wizard controller should like something like this.
class OrderWizard < ApplicationController

	def index
		# This is your wizards first page so get whatever objects you want
		# to have available to your template.
		
		# Let the template the wizard steps
		# wizard (:current_step, :previous_step, :next_step)
		wizard(:index, :index, :add_item)
	end
	
	def add_item
		@items = Item.find(:all)
		wizard(:add_item, :index) # There is no next step. You either submit the form or you go back.
	end
	
	# This method just saves the item from the submited form from add_item
	def save_item
		@item = Item.new(params[:item])
		wizard(:save_item, :add_item, :complete_order) # Now you can go back and add another item or finish your order.
	end
		
	# The order is complete and saved. So what do we do for next page?
	# Simple we can direct the user wherever we want. Because in the 
	# template we can change the name of the link like "Home" or "Add Item".
	# So let's set previous_step to the start page of the wizard
	# and keep next_step empty.
	def complete_order
		Order.complete(params[:id])
		wizard(:complete_order, :index)
	end

end

Now in our templates we can do something like
views/orderwizard/index

Some HTMl here...
<%= link_to_next_step :order_wizard, :add_an_item %>

this will build something like 
<a href="/orderwizard/add_item">Add an item</a>

Here are all the available helpers

<%= current_wizard_step %><br/> # prints the current step
<%= next_wizard_step %><br/> # prints the next step
<%= previous_wizard_step %><br/> # prints the previous step
<%= link_to_next_step :wizard_name %><br/> # Link text defaults to "Next"
<%= link_to_previous_step :wizard_name %><br/> # Link text defauts to "Previous"
<%= link_to_next_step :wizard_name, :before_this %><br/> # Set link text to "Before this"
<%= link_to_previous_step :wizard_name, :after_this %><br/># Set link text to "After this"
